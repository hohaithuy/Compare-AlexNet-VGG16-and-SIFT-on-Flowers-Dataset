# Compare-AlexNet-VGG16-and-SIFT-on-Flowers-Dataset
This is a project assignment for my CS231 classes, but I think it might be interesting for some beginner like me, who is learning about CNN Architecture

### Dataset
First, you can collect my data I have used for this repo on Kaggle: [link to Kaggle!](https://www.kaggle.com/thyhhi/flowers-dataset).

I collected it from Google Photos, you can see how I collect that from here [Scrape Data On Google Photos](https://github.com/hohaithuy/Compare-AlexNet-VGG16-and-SIFT-on-Flowers-Dataset/tree/main/ScrapeData)
